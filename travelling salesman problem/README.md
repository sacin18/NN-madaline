it runs on openGL using "branch and bound" algorithm on windows systems.

here's how you run it:

1/ please download all the content and extract the contents of glutming.zip in any directory.

2/ in the folder GLUTmingw32 copy the file glut32.dll

3/ if your system is a 64 bit system then paste the glut32.dll file in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ . you will be prompted for 
	permission select yes.
	
   if your system is a 32 bit system then paste the glut32.dll file in C:\Windows\System32\ .you will be prompted for
	permission select yes.
	
<after this you can delete the folder GLUTmingw32 if you want>

4/ now you can run the "exe" file main.exe to view the output of the project.

note! this process is only for the first time that you open the exe file. once the process is done you can directly
	click on the exe file to run it from the second time or whenever after pasting glut32.dll in the above folder.
