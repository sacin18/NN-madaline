it works properly only on linux systems and executable file runs only on linux systems.

openGL library should definately be installed to run the project.

the projects runns natively on the same system i.e. "127.0.0.1", to change the ip address edit the file mix.hpp

in mix.hpp look for the comment "change ip address here" and change the ip address in the function below it into the ip address of the server/other system.
